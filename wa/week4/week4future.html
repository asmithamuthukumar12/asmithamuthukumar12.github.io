     <h3>My Future!</h3>
        <ul> 
            <p> The biggest goal I'm currently working towards is making my own game! It's something I've always wanted to do and it's what pushed me to be a CTD major! I also want to grow enough as a digital artist / 3d animator to make my own visuals, too. In the short term, I'm attempting to learn Unreal Engine and a little bit of Blender. </p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <p> Some of my smaller goals include painting more, learning how to animate, working on refining my art skills, and learning how to cook! I'm also interested in opening my own shop!</p>

        </ul>
