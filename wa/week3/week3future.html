     <h2>My Future!</h2>
        <ul> 
            <p> The biggest goal I'm currently working towards is making my own game! It's something I've always wanted to do and it's what pushed me to be a CTD major! I also want to grow enough as a digital artist / 3d animator to make my own visuals, too. In the short term, I'm attempting to learn Unreal Engine and a little bit of Blender. </p>
